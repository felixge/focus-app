# Focus.app

A tiny [Think](http://freeverse.com/mac/product/?id=7013) clone that actually
works with a dual (or single) screen setup.

## Install

1. Download [here](http://github.com/downloads/felixge/focus-app/Focus.app.zip)
2. Install by unzipping an moving the contained file to `/Applications`

## What does it do?

It basically does the same thing the original Think app does. By default it
hides all windows, except a single one that you are focusing on. It provides
the same shortcuts as Think to re-focus on the current window or designate a
new window to be the focused one.

## How to use it?

1. Start Focus.app, it will cover all you screens with a black backdrop
2. Bring up an app using `Alt + Tab` or selecting it from your dock
3. Focus on the currently active app using `Option + Command + Tab`
4. Go back to the black backdrop using `Option + Command + Return`
5. Re-focus on the app you last focused on using `Control + Command + Return`

Clicking on the backdrop performs the same re-focusing as
`Control + Command + Return`.
